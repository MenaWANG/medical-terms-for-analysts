## üí° Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Chest X-ray Report
- **Code**: 71045
- **Description**: Radiologic examination, chest; single view
- **Report Excerpt**: "Clear lung fields bilaterally. Normal thoracic cavity. Trachea midline. No pleural effusions noted."
- **Breakdown**: This report uses three of our terms (thoracic, trachea, pleural) in describing normal anatomy.

### Example 2: Medical Record
- **Code**: J98.11
- **Description**: Atelectasis
- **Report Example**: "Right lower lobe atelectasis noted, with slight deviation of bronchi. No pleural effusion present. Thorax otherwise normal."
- **Interpretation**: This shows how these anatomical terms are used together in clinical documentation.
