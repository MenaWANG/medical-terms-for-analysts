# Medical Terms for Analysts

A personal learning project to build fluency in **medical terminology** with a focus on practical use in the **health insurance industry**.  

As a data scientist, I often analyze hospital, medical, and ancillary claim data. This repo is my structured way to understand the language behind those claims, so I can bridge **clinical concepts** with **data and analytics**.

## üéØ Goals

- Learn how medical words are formed and decoded  
- Understand common terms across body systems and specialties  
- Recognize terminology in hospital/medical claims (ICD, CPT, DRG, etc.)  
- Build a reusable glossary and cheat sheets for future reference

## üìö Learning Areas

This repo is organized into four major areas of learning:

### 1. Foundations & Building Blocks
- Prefixes, suffixes, and root words  
- How to break down complex terms into components  
- Example: *hypertension* = hyper- (high) + -tension (pressure)  

### 2. Body Systems
- Terminology grouped by system (cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, etc.)  
- Common conditions and procedures for each  
- Links to example claim codes  

### 3. Common Claims & Procedures
- ICD codes (diagnoses)  
- CPT/HCPCS codes (procedures & services)  
- DRG codes (hospital inpatient groupings)  
- Ancillary services (labs, radiology, pharmacy)  

### 4. Insurance & Clinical Context
- How terminology shows up in claims data fields  
- Chronic vs acute conditions in data  
- Applying terms in case studies and real-world scenarios
